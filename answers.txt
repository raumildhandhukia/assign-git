•  What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
-> .gitignore file allows Git to ignore some specific files when committing the project to the remote repository.
   For Java project it should include .war, .jar, .ear, .idea, .iml, .project, .classpath, .class which IDE generates.
   
•  What does fast-forward in git mean? 
-> The tip of your main branch is moved forward to the end of your feature branch using fast-forward merges. 
   This cleanly integrates your feature branch back into your main branch while maintaining the sequential order 
   of all contributions made there.

•  Why should you have different branches? 
-> Branches generates another area of development that is entirely seperate from the main and stable branch.
   Branches helps when multiple people are concurrently working on the same project. Because of branching stable
   code stays error free and multiple people can develop features upon the stable branch.

•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
-> It depends upon the project. Small projects can be handled with single repository while big projects require
   multiple repositories.
